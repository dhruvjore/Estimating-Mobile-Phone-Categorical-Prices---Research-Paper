The price of mobile phones significantly impacts their market success and sustainability. It is crucial to estimate the
price of a mobile phone before its release to ensure optimal marketing and competitiveness with other products in the market.
This prediction requires the collection of data on existing mobile phones and the application of different algorithms to reduce
complexity and identify the most critical selection features for comparison within the data. Using machine learning techniques
like forward and backward selection helps to find the best price with maximum specifications. In this study, we collected data on
mobile phones; specifications and features like camera, video, processor quality, and material quality. The dataset is complex to
collect due to the thousands of mobile phone releases each year. Therefore, we selectively choose features to reduce the dataset;s
complexity and get an estimate of the price to release the product in the market. The Logistic Regression predicts the mobile
phone;s price in three categories (low-priced, moderately priced, and highly priced).

In this collaborative effort to predict mobile phone prices before release, I played a significant role in researching and delving into the intricate specifications of various mobile phones. My contributions can be summarized as follows:

Research and Data Collection:
Conducted extensive research on the latest trends and features in mobile phones.
Collected a diverse dataset encompassing specifications such as camera quality, video capabilities, processor performance, and material quality. This dataset served as the foundation for our predictive model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Applied thorough Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to gain insights into the structure and patterns within the collected dataset.
Utilized visualizations to highlight key trends, correlations, and outliers, aiding the team in making informed decisions about feature selection.

Feature Selection:
Contributed to the process of selecting relevant features from the extensive dataset to reduce complexity.
Collaborated with the team to identify the most critical features that significantly impact the pricing of mobile phones.

Algorithmic Implementation:
Played a key role in implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly Logistic Regression, to predict mobile phone prices.
Applied forward and backward selection techniques to optimize the model's performance and identify the most influential features.

Categorization of Mobile Phone Prices:
Implemented a three-category prediction model for mobile phone prices, classifying them as low-priced, moderately priced, and highly priced.
Ensured that the model's output aligns with market expectations and aids in strategic decision-making for optimal marketing.

Documentation and Communication:
Actively documented the processes, methodologies, and findings for effective collaboration within the team.
Communicated insights and results clearly, ensuring that the team had a comprehensive understanding of the project's progress.

Continuous Improvement:
Engaged in ongoing discussions and iterations to refine the model and enhance its predictive accuracy.
Actively sought feedback from team members to implement improvements and stay abreast of emerging trends in the mobile phone industry.
By contributing to these aspects of the project, I aimed to ensure the successful estimation of mobile phone prices pre-release, facilitating optimal marketing strategies and competitiveness in the dynamic market landscape.
